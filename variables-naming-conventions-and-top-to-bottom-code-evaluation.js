/*

Objective:
In this activity, you will reinforce the skill of creating and using variables
while practicing best practices in variable naming conventions through a hands-on,
interactive coding challenge.

The code snippet below may include:
  - Ambiguous or incorrect variable names.
  - Missing variables that need to be created.
  - Scenarios that require the use of clear and descriptive variable names.

You will:
  - Identify Issues: Review the provided code and identify any variable names that:
  - Are unclear or too vague (e.g., a, b, c).
  - Do not follow best practices (e.g., camelCase, descriptive naming).
  - Refactor the Code: Rename the variables and rewrite the program using descriptive names that clearly convey the variable's purpose.
  - Enhance the Program: Add at least two additional variables to improve the programâ€™s functionality or clarity.

Things to reflect on:
  - Why is it important to use meaningful variable names?
  - What are the common pitfalls to avoid when naming variables?
  - How do clear variable names benefit team collaboration?

let customerName = "Alice";
let itemQuantity = 5;
let itemPrice = 20;
//Improvements
let totalCost = itemQuantity * itemPrice;
let discount = 0.1;
let discountedPrice = totalCost * (1 - discount);

let receipt = customerName + " bought " + itemQuantity +   " items at $ " + itemPrice + " each. The total cost, with a discount, is " + discountedPrice;

console.log(receipt);
